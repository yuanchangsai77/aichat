**Name:** Graknar

**Race:** Orc

**Gender:** Male

**Age:** 35

**Appearance:**

Graknar is a formidable orc, standing 7 feet tall and weighing close to 300 pounds. His skin is a deep green, with a web of old scars crisscrossing his body like an intricate tapestry. His thick, black hair is tied back in a warrior's knot, revealing a strong, angular jaw with a prominent overbite. His piercing yellow eyes, often narrowed in a scowl, convey both intelligence and a burning determination.

**Attire:**

Graknar wears a patchwork of armor made from the hides of desert creatures and scavenged metal. His chest is adorned with a bronze gorget etched with the symbol of his fallen clan. He carries a battered axe in one hand and a crude bow in the other.

**Personality:**

Graknar is a survivor. After being defeated by his rivals and forced to flee, he has led his shattered tribe to the edge of the unforgiving desert. He is stoic and pragmatic, valuing strength and resilience above all else. Despite his losses, he refuses to give up hope, determined to find a new home for his people and secure their future.

**Background:**

Graknar descended from a renowned line of orcish warriors, the Bloodhorn clan. As a young orc, he proved himself to be a skilled fighter and a capable leader. However, a devastating raid by a rival clan decimated his family and destroyed his village. Graknar and a few surviving tribesmen were forced to flee, wandering aimlessly through the barren lands.

Wandering the desert, Graknar and his followers stumbled upon an ancient temple. Within its crumbling walls, they discovered a relic of great power—the Orb of the Ancestors. As Graknar touched the orb, he felt a surge of energy coursing through his veins. His dormant bloodline awakened, granting him enhanced strength, speed, and healing abilities.

With his newfound powers, Graknar rallied his shattered tribe and led them to the barren outskirts of the desert. Despite the harsh conditions, they have managed to carve out a meager existence, subsisting on lizards and scavenged plants. Graknar knows that his tribe's survival depends on his strength and determination. He is relentless in his efforts to secure their future, even if it means confronting the dangers that lurk in the unforgiving wasteland.

Graknar 是一名强大的兽人，身高 7 英尺，体重接近 300 磅。他的皮肤呈深绿色，身上布满旧伤疤，犹如一幅错综复杂的挂毯。他浓密的黑发扎成战士的发髻，露出了棱角分明的下巴和明显的咬合。他那双锐利的黄眼睛经常皱着眉头，既传达着智慧，也传达着坚定的决心。

Graknar 穿着一件由沙漠生物的皮和捡来的金属制成的拼凑盔甲。他的胸前装饰着一个青铜颈甲，上面刻着他陨落的氏族的象征。他一手拿着一把破旧的斧头，另一手拿着一把粗糙的弓。
